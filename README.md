Jough Donakowski's Personal Website & Blog
This is the source code for my personal website and blog, a place to share my projects, writing, and various interests.

Current Status
The site is currently a single-page placeholder while the full blog is under construction. It is built to be easily expandable when new content is ready.

Tech Stack
HTML5 with semantic tags for better structure and accessibility.

Tailwind CSS for styling.

Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (theme toggle, header particle effect).

Hosted On
This project is proudly hosted on Netlify.

Getting Started
Since this is a simple static site, you can open the index.html file directly in your browser to view it locally.

Future Plans
The long-term goal is to migrate this single-page site to a Static Site Generator (SSG) like Astro or Eleventy to make managing blog content easier and more scalable.
