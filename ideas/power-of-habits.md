We often convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it's losing weight, building a business, or learning a new skill, we feel pressure to make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.

But what if the key to success isn't giant leaps, but tiny, incremental steps? This is the core idea behind the concept of "atomic habits"—small, easy-to-do routines that, over time, compound into remarkable results.

### The 1% Rule
Improving by just 1% isn't notable—sometimes it isn't even noticeable. But it can be far more meaningful in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up **thirty-seven times better** by the time you’re done.

Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
