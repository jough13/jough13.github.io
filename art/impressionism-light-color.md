# Capturing a Moment: The Magic of Impressionism

In the mid-19th century, a group of young Parisian artists rebelled against the rigid standards of the French art establishment. Their radical approach, which focused on capturing the fleeting sensory effect of a scene—the "impression"—would become known as Impressionism.

### A New Way of Seeing
Instead of painting historical or mythological scenes in a studio, Impressionists like **Claude Monet**, **Pierre-Auguste Renoir**, and **Edgar Degas** often worked outdoors (*en plein air*). This allowed them to observe the changing effects of light and atmosphere directly.

Key characteristics of Impressionism include:
- **Short, thick brushstrokes:** To capture the essence of the subject rather than its details.
- **Emphasis on light:** Artists focused on how light reflects off surfaces and how its quality changes over time.
- **Modern subject matter:** They painted everyday life—landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits of ordinary people.

The movement was initially met with scorn from the critics, but it ultimately paved the way for modern art and remains one of the most beloved art forms in the world.
