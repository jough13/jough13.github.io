        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 9, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Health Physics Toolbox</strong> mobile application (the "App") developed by <strong>Joseph Donakowski</strong>.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>The App is designed to operate as a strictly offline utility for health physics calculations. <strong>We do not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal data, usage statistics, or user-generated content.</strong></p>
        <p>The App does not require an internet connection to function, and it has no mechanism to send data to external servers.</p>

        <h2>2. Local Device Storage</h2>
        <p>The App utilizes your device's local storage (e.g., LocalStorage) solely for the purpose of improving user experience. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saving your interface preferences (e.g., Light Mode vs. Dark Mode).</li>
            <li>Temporarily persisting your most recent calculation inputs (e.g., isotope selection or decay parameters) so you do not lose work if you close the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is stored entirely on your device. It is not accessible by the developer or any third parties and is removed if you clear the App's data or uninstall the App.</p>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requires minimal permissions to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internet Access:</strong> While the App is offline-first, standard network permissions may be present in the application bundle to support the underlying web-view framework. However, no data is transmitted.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) and does not display third-party advertisements.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. As no data is collected at all, this App is safe for use by all age groups.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact the developer.</p>
