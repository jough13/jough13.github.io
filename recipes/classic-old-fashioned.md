The Old Fashioned is the quintessential American cocktail. It's simple, strong, and sophisticated. When made correctly, it's a perfectly balanced drink that highlights the quality of the whiskey. Here's how to make a great one every time.

### Ingredients
- 1 Sugar cube (or 1 tsp of simple syrup)
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- A splash of water or club soda
- 2 oz Bourbon or Rye Whiskey
- Orange peel for garnish

### Instructions
1.  **Muddle the sugar:** Place the sugar cube in a rocks glass. Add the dashes of bitters on top of it, followed by a small splash of water. Muddle everything together until the sugar is mostly dissolved, creating a simple syrup at the bottom of the glass.
2.  **Add the ice:** Place one large ice cube or a few smaller ones into the glass. A large cube is preferred as it melts slower and chills the drink with less dilution.
3.  **Pour the whiskey:** Pour your chosen bourbon or rye over the ice.
4.  **Stir:** Stir the drink gently for about 15-20 seconds. This chills the whiskey and incorporates the sweet, bitter base.
5.  **Garnish:** Take a fresh piece of orange peel. Squeeze it over the drink to express its oils onto the surface, then rub the peel around the rim of the glass. Drop the peel into the drink.

Enjoy responsibly!
