**The Concept:** This meal is designed for maximum flavor with minimal active effort. We’re using the slow cooker to create incredibly tender, savory pork while simultaneously whipping up a quick, aromatic beef broth on the stove. The result is a rich, satisfying sandwich paired with a lighter soup that tastes like it simmered all day.

## Instructions

### Phase 1: The Slow Cooker Pork
We want the pork to be savory, slightly sweet, and tender enough to shred effortlessly.

1. **Prep the Meat:** Place the pork shoulder into your slow cooker. If it’s a very large piece, you can cut it into two or three chunks to help it cook more evenly.
2. **Make the Sauce:** In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, fish sauce (this adds that essential deep, salty flavor), brown sugar, minced garlic, and grated ginger.
3. **Cook:** Pour the sauce over the pork, ensuring it’s well-coated. Cover and cook on **Low for 7–8 hours** or **High for 4–5 hours**.
4. **The Secret Step:** Once the pork is tender, shred it directly in the pot so it soaks up the juices.  
   > **Pro Tip:** Spread the shredded meat onto a baking sheet and broil it for 3–5 minutes. This crisps up the edges, giving you a wonderful mix of textures—soft inside, crispy outside.

### Phase 2: The Quick Pickles
A Banh Mi isn't complete without this tangy crunch to cut through the richness of the meat and mayo.

1. **Chop:** Shred the red cabbage and slice the carrot into thin matchsticks. *Note: We are swapping the traditional daikon radish for cabbage here for extra crunch and vibrancy.*
2. **Dissolve:** In a bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until the sugar is completely dissolved.
3. **Marinate:** Toss the cabbage and carrots in the brine and let them sit in the fridge for at least one hour. Drain well before using.

### Phase 3: The "Cheat" Beef Noodle Soup
Here is how we get deep, smoky flavor without simmering bones for 12 hours.

1. **Char the Aromatics:** Cut the onion and the piece of ginger in half. Place them cut-side up on a baking sheet and broil them for about 5 minutes until they are blackened and charred. This char is what gives the broth its authentic, smoky depth.
2. **Simmer:** Add the charred onion and ginger to a pot with the beef broth, star anise, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a gentle simmer for 20 minutes to infuse the flavors.
3. **Finish:** Strain out the solids so you have a clear broth. Stir in a splash of fish sauce to season.
4. **Serve:** Pour the hot broth over prepared Thai rice noodles. Drop in a slice or two of fresh jalapeño for a little kick.

### Phase 4: Assembly
Building the perfect sandwich is all about the layers.

1. **Toast the Bread:** Slice your baguette and toast it. You want the outside to be crispy and flaky, while the inside remains soft.
2. **Spread:** Slather a generous amount of mayonnaise on both sides of the bread. This adds creaminess and protects the bread from getting soggy.
3. **Layer:** Pile on a heap of the warm, shredded pork.
4. **The Crunch:** Add a layer of the pickled cabbage and carrots, followed by a leaf of crisp lettuce for texture and color.
5. **Top:** Finish with fresh cilantro, cool cucumber slices, and extra jalapeños if you like heat.

*Serve the sandwich with a hot bowl of the beef noodle soup on the side for dipping or sipping.*
