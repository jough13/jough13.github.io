There are few things more comforting than a slice of classic, homemade lasagna. This recipe is all about developing deep, rich flavors with a savory meat sauce and a creamy béchamel. It takes a little time, but the results are absolutely worth it.

Ingredients
For the Meat Sauce
1 tbsp olive oil

1 large onion, finely chopped

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 lb ground beef

1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

2 tbsp tomato paste

1 tsp dried oregano

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

For the Béchamel Sauce
4 tbsp butter

1/4 cup all-purpose flour

3 cups whole milk

Pinch of nutmeg

Salt and white pepper to taste

For Assembly
1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles, cooked al dente

1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

1 lb mozzarella cheese, shredded

Instructions
Make the Meat Sauce: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon. Drain any excess fat.

Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it cook for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.

Make the Béchamel Sauce: While the meat sauce simmers, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute to create a roux. Gradually whisk in the milk until the mixture is smooth. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens (about 8-10 minutes). Remove from heat and stir in the nutmeg, salt, and white pepper.

Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.

Arrange a single layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.

Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce. Sprinkle with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

Repeat the layers (noodles, béchamel, meat sauce, cheese) until all ingredients are used, ending with a final layer of béchamel and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.

Bake: Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.

Pro Tip: Let the lasagna rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting into it. This allows the layers to set, making it much easier to serve clean slices.

Enjoy your delicious, homemade lasagna!
